REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Summary

During this project I learned a lot, how to think when planning out a project and how to start putting the pieces together. I found a great use for functions and how to get them to control and interact with eachother, and also how to let the user control the flow of the program with the help of functions. I had to google a lot of things, like how to use buttons and collecting information about whether they have been clicked on or not, and also how to use checkboxes.
But my most important takeaway from this project was learning how to think when coding and understanding that previous parts of the code that has been written sometimes need to be changed in order to get new parts of the code to work together with the rest.

I did not completely managed to stick to my budget as most of the time was spent researching how to write the code and how to use all the different functions and different elements. That left very little time left for bug testing.

If I still had more time in this project the biggest improvement I would want to implement is local storage, allowing the user to create a list and come back to the same list at a later point. In the current version of the code this is not possible - and if the user closes the window or tab they will return to a blank list.

# User Guide

The program can be used to create your own "To do" list. To add a new task, simply write the task in the textbox and click "Add". 
The task will now be shown in the "TO DO" list.
You can add as many tasks as you want.

When you have completed the task you can move it to the "COMPELTED TASKS" list by clicking on the checkbox to the left of the task.

If you wish to move a task back to the "TO DO" list you simply click on the checkbox next to task again.

If you want to remove a task from either list completely - click on the "Remove button". This action cannot be undone.
